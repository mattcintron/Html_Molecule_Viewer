A small demo site I built to display chemical structure data called Molecule Viewer. It uses the Kekule js library tools in
a pure html5 site to show visual displays of molecules. The molecules can be shown in both 2D and 3D in addition there
is a chemical builder tool than can be used to edit and save your own structures. Data can be loaded in from chemical 
mol files and there are examples to test this with in the Mol Files folder inside the Project.
